The idea gained hundreds of users within the first few months and eventually grew to add social networks, to go beyond purely publishing to social media into analytics, engagement, and even to building micro sites. Today, Coding Hunter is one of the most well-known social media marketing softwares serving small businesses, creators, and individuals.<br/><br/>The Coding Hunter team was initially just a few people working on a project they believed in, and steadily started growing after the founders joined an accelerator in August 2011. Over the next few years, Coding Hunter teammates joined from wherever they were based as Coding Hunter’s founders traveled and built Coding Hunter. In 2013, we decided to commit to being a fully remote and distributed team, giving up our office space. That decision marked just one example of the Coding Hunter team choosing our own path with how we operate as we build Coding Hunter. We also share the whole team’s salaries, part of our value of transparency, and our whole company works a four-day work week. <br/><br/>All that to say, Coding Hunter is a product built to help our customers get off the ground and grow via organic marketing, and the Coding Hunter team is an optimistic and gratitude-filled group of remote workers scattered around the world and dedicated to creating a product our customers will use and love.</p></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json" crossorigin="">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/about","query":{},"buildId":"wu6UK5nIQtxSD7M2jOyk_","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
