Do you have an oily&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/t-zone-face\">T-zone</a>&nbsp;and dry cheeks, for instance? You may want different products for each area.</li>\r\n\t<li>Opt for gentle products that won&rsquo;t aggravate the skin.

Take it easy and space exfoliation sessions farther apart if needed.</li>\r\n</ul><br>\n<h3>Skin care tips for normal skin</h3><br>\n<p>&ldquo;Normal&rdquo; skin is characterized by being not particularly oily or dry.</p><br>\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Use a lotion or a cream at night rather than a gel moisturizer.</li>\r\n\t<li>Don&rsquo;t get carried away with new skin care products. Normal skin tends to require less maintenance.

This condition is common in lighter skin tones.</li>\r\n</ul><br>\n<p>Signs of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/skin/rosacea\">rosacea</a>&nbsp;include:</p><br>\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>flushed skin</li>\r\n\t<li>eye irritation</li>\r\n\t<li>small red bumps</li>\r\n</ul><br>\n<h3>Skin care tips for acne</h3><br>\n<p>Acne-prone skin can be difficult to treat. Here are a few tips to help you stay clear.</p><br>\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Know your type. Salicylic acid is good for whiteheads and blackheads, while benzoyl peroxide is better for deeper acne cysts.</li>\r\n\t<li>Stay moisturized. While you may want to dry your skin so that it&rsquo;s less oily, this will only result in your skin producing more oil to compensate.</li>\r\n\t<li>Really try not to pick! This can lead to permanent scarring.</li>\r\n\t<li>Sandwich your products. Use any acne-targeted treatment after your toner and before your moisturizer.</li>\r\n\t<li>Add retinol. Using retinol in the evening can target both acne and aging.</li>\r\n</ul><br>\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Speak with your doctor about persistent adult acne to find out about prescription treatment options.</p>\r\n</blockquote><br>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2><br>\n<p>Skin care tips for men</p><br>\n<p>Guess what?

It&rsquo;s important to talk with your healthcare provider before you begin using essential oils. Be sure to research the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/best-essential-oils\">quality</a>&nbsp;of a brand&rsquo;s products.
