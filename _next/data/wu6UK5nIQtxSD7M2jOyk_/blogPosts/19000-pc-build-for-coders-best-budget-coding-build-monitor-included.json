This time, I have decided to build the PC from purchase to assembly, step by step. Some people like pre-built but I never recommend them as they often come with components that might not perform well, and you usually can&#39;t pick what you want. Plus, upgrading them later is a pain. Building a custom build lets us choose exactly what we need for coding/gaming and opens up better options for upgrades down the line. Also, it&#39;s budget-friendly as we have the flexibility to slightly tweak the components. Let&#39;s build our coding pc!</p>\r<br>\r<br><h2>Component Summary&nbsp;</h2>\r<br>\r<br><p>Processor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QPmO6M\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AMD Ryzen 3 3200G desktop processor\">AMD Ryzen 3 3200G</a></p>\r<br>\r<br><p>Motherboard:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QMbvMr\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ant Value B450MAD4-N mATX</a></p>\r<br>\r<br><p>Ram: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3P7ps6s\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">XPG ADATA GAMMIX D30 DDR4 8GB</a></p>\r<br>\r<br><p>Storage:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/47Jb6Ap\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ZEB-SD26 256 GB Solid State Drive</a></p>\r<br>\r<br><p>Cabinet + PSU:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/47Fm2PP\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Artis 2520 2.0 C Computer Cabinet&nbsp;</a></p>\r<br>\r<br><p>Monitor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3P4KbrE\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ZEBRONICS Zeb-V16HD LED Monitor</a></p>\r<br>\r<br><p>&nbsp;</p>\r<br>\r<br><h2>Components</h2>\r<br>\r<br><h3>Processor</h3>\r<br>\r<br><p>For the processor, I have selected the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3QPmO6M\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"AMD Ryzen 3 3200G Desktop Processor\">AMD Ryzen 3 3200G</a>.
